# Remote-energy-sources-for-mixing-in-the-Indonesian-Seas
This project provides the data source of a nature communications paper. 
The paper is about the romote energy source for mixing i nthe indonesian Seas.
T_and_V.mat is the data source snapshot of the sea surface temperature in the Indonesain Seas.
advective_flux.mat, radiative_flux.mat, and divergence.mat provide the data used for plotting the advective flux, rediative flux and energy divergence within the Indonesian Seas.
depth.mat provides the data for energy flux vertical profiles in each Indonesian Straits.
blue_red_sturated.mat and Red.mat are two colormap files which are used in this paper.
