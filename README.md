# Remote-energy-sources-for-mixing-in-the-Indonesian-Seas
This project provides the data source of a nature communications paper. 
The paper is about the remote energy source for mixing in the Indonesian Seas.
T.mat is the data of a snapshot of the sea surface temperature in the Indonesain Seas, and is used to plot figure 1 in this paper.
advective_flux.mat, radiative_flux.mat, and radiative_divergence.mat provide the raw data used for plotting the advective flux, radiative flux and energy divergence within the Indonesian Seas. They are used to plot figure 2a, figure 2b and figure 3 separately. 
depth.mat provides the data for energy flux vertical profiles shown in figure 4.
blue_red_sturated.mat and Red.mat are two colormap files which are used in this paper.
scripts.m is the MATLAB script for all the figures in this paper.
blockmean.m, cmocean.m and runmean.m are functions used in the scripts. 
Plsese download all files into a folder and run the script.m at MATLAB. Then, you will get all of the figures in the paper.
